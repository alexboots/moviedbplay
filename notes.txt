TODO: general mini goals


Basic app:
[✔] add basic theme
[✔] add react router
  [✔] add basic routes
    [✔] /
    [✔] /movie/:page
    [] add burger menu at the side with all routes (home / lol nothing else I guess)
[✔] create list item section
  [✔] create movie list item
  [✔] create card item
  [✔] not to self: make sure images set height and witdh to no weird resizing issue on loading
[✔] add popular section on homepage
  [✔] add popular API
[✔] Add search bar
  [✔] style searchbar
[✔] Search bar
  ✔ => search resp
  ✔ => replaces 'popular section'
  ✔ => obviously trnasitionar load state to its obvius UI is being replaced
[✔] Give hover on homepage cards a 'get bigger' effect for the images
[✔] Add arrow to left / right of that other movies one but dont have them be clickable - idk maybe just use same card as on homepage for this as well - that would propelry show good reusablity

Probably don't have time stretch goals:
[] 'toggle' view from list to card view
  [] make card view for homepage
[] add infinite scroll w react-virtualized for loading more (homepage / wherever)
  => actually maybe use this for sake of simplicity https://github.com/CassetteRocks/react-infinite-scroller
  https://github.com/jaredpalmer/react-simple-infinite-scroll
[] create page that shows films by genre
  [] have 'left / right' scroll through each section google style
  [] 'see more' click to expand, takes you to seperate gerne page w infinite scroll
[] Add filtering by genre to search - maybe a select / options OR radio input under the search bar with 'name, genre, whatever else'
[✔] Show related movies
[] Add a page for individual actor details
[✔] Add a caching layer for your requests to the 3rd party API (not super needed if we throttle req + useSWR on frontend)
